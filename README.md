# Fun_PyToolkit

Hello! I'm a 12-year-old boy from India, and I learned Python entirely on my own out of curiosity at the age of 11. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve been on an exciting coding journeyâ€”exploring basic concepts, building small projects, and continuously learning new things.

--About This Program--
Fun_PyToolkit is an All-in-One Python program that contains 20 beginner to intermediate level mini-programs, including a Vending Machine Simulator, Encryption/Decryption tools, a Typing Speed Test, and more. This toolkit was created to sharpen my skills and share useful utilities with others.

--Why Version 2?--
In this initial version, youâ€™ll find some basic but functional programs. If you enjoy using this toolkit, stay tuned for Version 2, where I plan to introduce more advanced and unique projects!

#Important
If this shows an error or doesn't work plz open the main.py and remove that line or project_dir i added it because i was creating this on Pydroid 3 cuz i don't have any computer so i had to use that line but if it causes problems to you plz try removing it or ask ChatGPT ðŸ˜ƒ
